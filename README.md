<!-- 
* The glowing disk around the singlarity is called the accetion disk.
* The part below and above the singularity the part of the disk behind the black hole.  
* Because of the immense gravity of the singularity, the light gets bent and shows an image of the disk on top and bottom.  
* The gravitinal lens effect bends the light of the background around the singularity, creating a second image of objects.
* The wavelength of the light gets shortened the closer you get, shifting the color of the accetion disk from red to blue.
* Time also slows down the closer you are to the singularity.  
* The bright area on the left of the accretion disk is due to the relativistic Doppler effect.  
* The part moving towards the viewer is brighter than the part moving away.

## Patches  

![patches](./images/patches.png)  
_The black hole objects can be imported into a project with a single asp._

_Low load because 3D objects other than planes are not used._
